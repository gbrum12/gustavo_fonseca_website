        <h1>My Background: </h1>
        <p> My entire family is from Brazil. We are from Rio de Janeiro, the city with that big statue of Christ and the nicest beaches.<br> The culture down there is amazing, it feels like everyone is a part of one big family. And that also applies to my own family. <br> My dad's side of the family is portuguese and native brazilian. My mom's side is mixed, my middle name is german, and I <br>have no clue where that came from. Colonization in Brazil was a mess, so it's a little complicated to not be related to many races and nationalities. </P>
        <p> I lived in Rio for about 16 years, my life was probably what you would imagine if you have heard of Rio before.<br> I would go to the beach every week, I would go to the pool, play soccer, basketball, beach volleyball, and get acai.<br> I made a lot of friendships that will last forever, and leaving them was definitely the hardest part of coming here.
            <br> But with their support, basketball, and having my family, I am managing to not go crazy.</p>
