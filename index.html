   <h1>Gustavo Fonseca</h1>
  <h3>Personality:</h3>
  <p>I am really laid back and it is really hard to get me nervous.
 <br>I laugh at everything and also make people around me happier.</p>
 <hr>
<h3>Experiences and Interesting Facts:</h3>
  <p> I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and moved to Marin 14 months ago.
    <br>English is not my first language, and it probably wasn't my second until I got here (Sí, portuguese speakers can make up an accent and speak "portuspanish").
     In case you have never seen me I'm really tall and Basketball turned into my passion when I was 7, so yes, my height is not being wasted.<br> I won two South American tournaments, and a couple other State championships for a club called Flamengo.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Personal goals for this academic year: </h3>
<p>My #1 goal is to learn more about myself, what interests me in the school environment. <br> Other goals are to keep my grades up, so I can boost my GPA a little more, absorb knowledge from all my teachers and enjoy my last year in high school.

  <dt><strong>Family:</strong></dt>
<dd>The relationship I have built with my family, couldn't be any better. I lost my dad when I was 12 years old, and that brought my family closer, <br> my sister also had to become a "second mom" to me.The way my family works is perfect, everyone is essential and even family friends are considered, actual part of the family. <br>This is all possible because of the way our grandparents and parents created us. Without my family i  definetely wouldn't be where I'm at right now. </dd>
